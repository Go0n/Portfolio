I am a 5+ year web developer focused on making the web a better place.  Though I do enjoy working front end my skills are definitely better suitted for back end development.  I have used a multitude of resources for development which include Vagrant, Puppet, Bootstrap, Laravel, Ocktober CMS, ..etc.  I am eager to learn new technologies and love exploring new solutions which is often because of this ever changing web development community.  Things like M.E.A.N and other great changes in the web development world make programming that much more exciting!
