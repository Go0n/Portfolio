I am a 5+ year web developer focused on back end.  Though I do enjoy working front end my skills are definitely back end driven.  I have a multitude of resousers Vagrant, Puppet, Bootstrap, Laravel, Ocktober CMS, ..etc.  I am very eager to learn new technologies and love exploring into the ever changing web development community.  Things like M.E.A.N and other great changes in the web development world make programming that much more exciting!
