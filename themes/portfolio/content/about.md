I am a 5+ year web developer focused on making the web a better place. My skills are geared towards back end but I do enjoy tinkering with UI.  I have used a multitude of resources for development which include Vagrant, Puppet, Bootstrap, Laravel, Ocktober CMS, ..etc.  I am eager to learn new technologies either at work or in my personal time because staying up to date is probably one of the most important aspects of being a great programmer. The new popularity of M.E.A.N is exciting and shows change is always around the corner!
